# swipe-capture
 
## A swipe enabler for the reMarkable tablet.

This small program works in conjunction with `xochitl` to provide functionality.

It interprets screen presses and releases, so that a leftward swipe gesture is then reported as a left button press. This can be used in your own programs or reprogrammed to do more useful things.
